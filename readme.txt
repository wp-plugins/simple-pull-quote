= How do I update the look of the pull quotes? =

To change the look of your pull quotes, open your theme's "style.css" file and create a CSS class called "simplePullQuotes".  Edit this class according to your tastes.  **IMPORTANT:** Make sure your theme's "wp_head()" function comes before your theme's stylesheet or else this won't work.

= How do I use more than one pull quote in a single post or page? =

Simple Pull Quote currently supports up to 3 pull quotes in a single post or page.  To use the other two pull quotes, simply enter "quote1" and/or "quote2" into the custom field name and give it a custom field value of your quote(s).  Then, in the post/page, enter "[quote1]" and/or [quote2].
